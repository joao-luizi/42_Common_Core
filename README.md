|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| [**Libft**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_Common_Core_Libft)    | This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus. | 125/100  |
| [**ft_printf**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_ft_printf)| This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects. | 125/100  |
| [**Born2beRoot**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_Born2beroot) | This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. | 125/100 |
| [**get_next_line**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_get_next_line) | May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.        | 125/100 |
| [**push_swap**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_push_swap) |This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.               | 125/100 |
| [**minitalk**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_minitalk)  | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.                         | 125/100 |
| [**fract-ol**](https://github.com/joao-luizi/42_fract-ol)   |Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX.      | 125/100 |
